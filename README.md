# Sorting Hub

This is a JavaFX application that allows users to visualize and compare two different sorting algorithms (Merge Sort and Selection Sort) on an array of random integers. The user can select the algorithm to use and the size of the array to sort. The application uses multithreading to prevent the UI from freezing during the sorting process, and updates a graph in real-time to show the progress of the sorting algorithm.
